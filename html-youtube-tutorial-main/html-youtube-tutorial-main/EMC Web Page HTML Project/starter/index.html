        <p>In this video, I will explain what full stack development is and provide a detailed overview of the technologies used to build full stack web applications. Full stack web development involves building the front-end, back-end, and database components of a web application. This means that full stack developers are responsible for everything from designing the user interface to managing the server-side logic and database.</p>
        <p> will begin by discussing the key technologies and programming languages used in full stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and various front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. I will then move on to discuss the server-side technologies like Python, Java and Node Js, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Aws.</p>
        <h3>Lets Divide Full Stack into three parts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>front-end</li>
            <li>Backend</li>
            <li>Database</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technologies used for Full Stack Development</h2>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Frontend</th>
